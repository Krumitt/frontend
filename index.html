                <h2>What is Bouldering?
                </h2>
            </strong>
            <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls
                without
                the
                use of ropes or harnesses.


            </p>
            <p>Unlike traditional climbing, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems,"
                typically
                keeping
                climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.



            </p>
            <p>Experience the perfect blend of <b>physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving</b> as you
                navigate routes close
                to the
                ground,
                with nothing but a crash pad and determination. Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form,
                making it
                both
                <strong>accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts</strong>.
